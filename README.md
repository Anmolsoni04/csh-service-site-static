# Cybershields Technology Service Site (React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + react-spring)

A clean, modern landing page inspired by the Agensia Webflow template, rebuilt from scratch with React, Vite, Tailwind, and react-spring.
Content and images are placeholders. No assets from the template are copied.

## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm create
# or use npm/yarn/pnpm to install
cd agensia-landing
npm install
npm run dev
```

> Requirements: Node 18+

## Install

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Libraries

- Tailwind CSS for styling
- react-spring for scroll and text effects (useSpring, useTrail, useScroll)
- IntersectionObserver hook for in-view animations

## Notes

- This is a fresh implementation, not a pixel-perfect clone.
- Replace Unsplash URLs with your own images as needed.
- You can tweak animations in each component for timing/physics.
